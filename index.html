            <ul>
              <li>Design and prototype a temperature probe that operates in temperatures as low as 0° F and is 
                  capable of drilling into the lunar subsurface to collect, store and transmit data relating to 
                  the thermal dissipation rates in a 4-student team.
              </li>

              <li>Design and test over 23 iterations of both Alpha and Beta versions of custom schematic drawings 
                  and printed circuit boards using Altium PCB Design Software to support two different voltage 
                  regulators and integrate a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.
              </li>

              <li>Design prototype mounts for an EVA compatible 24-pin connector allowing users to feasibly connect 
                  the temperature probe to an external intelligence package within the SOLIDWORKS design software.
              </li>
              <li>Create a Graphical User Interface webpage using HTML and JavaScript that allows remote access and 
                  control at a range of 70 meters through IEEE 802.11n wireless communication protocol.
              </li>

              <li>Construct a drill mechanism for the temperature probe to be capable of manual installation at a 
                  depth of 70 centimeters in compact regolith on the lunar surface.
              </li>

              <li>Document all stages of a product life cycle starting from the research, development, testing, 
                  integration, and prototyping of the temperature probe which has proved crucial to further the 
                  development for my team.

          <ul>
            <li>Provided direct assistance to Research Scientists in collecting and analyzing data, rapid 
                prototyping, and programming digital tools to manage data collection and storage.
            </li>

            <li>Collaborated in a team of four members using the Git Lab platform to create Python scripts 
                resulting in improved workflow efficiency among the department.
            </li>

            <li>Created tools within the Linux operating system using Python to code three different tools to 
                read and organize image processing data and metadata from data collection event files averaging 
                at 50 Gigabytes per event and in the HDF5, YAML, and Python Notebook formats, saving about 2.5 
                hours daily.
            </li>

            <li>Designed a new prototype within FreeCAD software and laser-cut the new microfluidic blood tests 
                resulting in a 20% reduction in materials exhausted per test and 30% reduction in time required 
                for assembly.
